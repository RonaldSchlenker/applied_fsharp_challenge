This article covers the core concept of handling stateful functions in a pure way. The basis for this article is an experimental OSS project I started a year ago. It is called FluX (it was called FLooping before, and I will propably change the name again). You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/ronaldschlenker/FluX).

FluX has already some things that this article doesn't cover, which are:

* You can actually play sounds, using a Node audio server or CSAudio as backend.
* There is a small library of effects and oscillators (hp, lp, sin, rect, tri, etc.)
*
