[SGF1]Hello, my name is Suzanne G. Fox, and I am looking forward to proofreading your text for you. I will do my utmost best to correct all mistakes and point out how you can further improve your work in my comments.

[SGF2]"Which" introduces non-restrictive clauses; "that" introduces restrictive clauses. They are not interchangeable.
[SGF3]This change improves the sentence structure.
[SGF4]"Where" is only used for physical locations.
[SGF5]This construction is awkward, but it is necessary.
[SGF6]I've corrected this spelling per Merriam-Webster's dictionary, which is the standard in many arms of the publishing industry.
[SGF7]The use of the word "like" here indicates that the list that follows will not be all-inclusive, so you don't need to add "etc." or "among others" or similar wording at the end of the list.
[SGF8]Should this be "diodes"?
[SGF9]Contractions are not used in formal written English, but I'm following your lead here on the theory that this is a less formal article, not an academic one. If I'm wrong about this, by all means change all the contractions to the long form of the word--in this case, it would be "do not."
[SGF10]This is a little unclear--do you mean you don't have to read the Wikipedia article to understand your article? Please clarify this.
[SGF11]If you don't have co-authors, "I" is better than "we," especially since you started out referring to yourself as "I."
[SGF12]This improves the phrasing.
[SGF13]The period precedes the quotation mark in U.S. usage.
[SGF14]Is this what you meant?
[SGF15]Is this what you meant?
[SGF16]You have not indented the paragraphs up until now, so I am deleting the indentions from here on.
[SGF17]Book titles are usually italicized.
[SGF18]Since you've been using the second person ("you") up until now, it's better not to shift to the more formal third person ("one") for the sake of consistency. Given the informal tone of your article, I think "you" is a better choice.
[SGF19]I've capitalized this to match the style you have already established.
[SGF20]Should this be parameters? Something different?
[SGF21]Very small numbers (less than 10) are usually written out.
[SGF22]Is this what you meant?
[SGF23]This abbreviation is preceded and followed by commas.
[SGF24]This improves the sentence structure.
[SGF25]There should be no spaces on either side of a slash mark.
[SGF26]I've capitalized and punctuated the list per the rules of seriation.
[SGF27]There's no apostrophe in the possessive form of this word.
[SGF28]This is an improved verb tense.
[SGF29]Should this be common?
[SGF30]This was lowercased previously, and since you've already described it, there's no need to enclose it in quotation marks.
[SGF31]This is an improved word choice.
[SGF32]Is this the correct spelling?
[SGF33]This is an improved transition.
[SGF34]This change improves the sentence structure.
[SGF35]If this is not a direct quote, please consider hyphenating "object-oriented."
[SGF36]"Data" is a plural noun and thus takes a plural verb.
[SGF37]Please consider identifying the chapter by number here to avoid any possible confusion.
[SGF38]This is an improved verb tense.
[SGF39]
[SGF40R39]Many times this is capitalized, but sometimes, it is not. Please review this issue.
[SGF41]This improves the sentence structure.
[SGF42]Is this what you meant?
[SGF43]Did you mean "higher-level computations"?
[SGF44]Previously, this was capitalized.
[SGF45]Is this what you meant?
[SGF46]This change improves the sentence structure.
[SGF47]The imperative tense ("shall") is used in only a handful of very specific situations and never as a substitute for the future tense ("will").
[SGF48]I've corrected this to match the structure of the rest of the sentence.
[SGF49]Should "bind" also be capitalized?
[SGF50]I've changed the verb tense to correspond to the rest of the sentence.
[SGF51]Is this a note to yourself?
[SGF52]You can almost always eliminate "in order," and doing so will strengthen your writing.
[SGF53]This is an improved word choice.
[SGF54]Which code do you mean? Will the reader know automatically, with no possible confusion?
[SGF55]This should be a comma, not a semicolon.
[SGF56]This is an improved transition.
[SGF57]Did you mean relay? Relax? Something different? I'm not finding a definition for this spelling that is involved in writing code, but perhaps this is correct.
[SGF58]Is this what you meant?
[SGF59]This is one word.
[SGF60]Which list do you mean?
[SGF61]This change improves the sentence structure.
[SGF62]This improves the sentence structure.
[SGF63]This change improves the sentence structure.
[SGF64]I'm thinking there should be a period after "slow."
[SGF65]This improves the sentence structure.
