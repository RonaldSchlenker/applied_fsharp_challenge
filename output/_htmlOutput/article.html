          <h1>Digital Signal Processing with F# (in the Domain of Audio and Music)</h1>
<h2>Einleitung und Motivation</h2>
<p>Making music with the help of computers is not a new approach. It started with music N (TODO: Nochmal ausbauen)...
In the analog world, physical quantities like the electric currency are used to represent a signal that is finally sent to a speaker. Thes quantities are created and altered by low-level components like condensors, resistors, magnetic coils, transistors, diods, etc. which are connected to each others in circuits. They are composed to larger components like operational amplifiers, that are again used to build modules like filters and oscillators which synthesizers and effect processors are made of. Digital audio signal processing (Audio-DSP) is about modeling these components on different levels of abstraction, resulting in the simulation of circuits similar to their analog counterparts (of course, there is no limit in creating completely new forms of synthesizers and effects). If you are already familiar with languages like Java or C#, you might think that DSP fits perfectly in the world of object-oriented programming languages: With it's basic idea of encapsulating mutable state by behavior (methods) and giving it an addressable identity (instance pointer), it maps directly to the concept of having physical entities (like condensors or transistors) that "exist" and hold their's own state that changes over time. This article is about an alternative approach of audio-DSP which is solely based on the paradigm of pure functions using a language called F#. TODO: Benefits</p>
<p>(<strong><em></em></strong>
We will learn that object-oriented concept like instances (and therfore instanciation) as well as aspects of method evaluation can be left out completely, leading to a way of describing signal flows and circuits purely focussing on how values flow through the system.</p>
<p>Key point: Eigentlich denkt man: OO,  ...this leads to - well, it lead me to pure functions!
"Well, it lead me to pure functional programming, and we will see why it is superior to an object-oriented approach when we want to express stateful computations.

<h2>Abgrenzung</h2>
<ul>
<li>Audio signals (means: at the end, we are interested in a sequence of float values)</li>
<li>Time domain only</li>
<li>Performance: Not considered here.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Brief Definition of DSP</h2>
<p>Digital signal processing - in contrast to analog signal processing - deals with quantized values over a discrete time. What does it mean: Take an analog synthesizer. It creates and outputs a signal based on electric currency - which is continuous from a physical point of view. A computer cannot process values in a continuous way - it has to <em>quantize</em> two things:
<em> Time: This is called sampling, and happens for an audio signal usually at multiples of 44100 times per second (44.1 kHz). Why 44100? Look at TODO: Sample Theorem.
</em> Values: At each sample point, a value must be captured (analog to the electric currency). This happens usually in a number, represented by a 16, 32 or 64 bit value. In this article, we use a F# "float" value, which is a 64 bit floating point number.</p>
<p>Having understood the definition from above, it's easy to define what a signal is: <strong>A signal is a value that changes over time</strong>. Sampling of these values with constant time intervals results in a sequence of values:</p>
<p>TODO: Plot</p>
<p>As we can see, we have captured a sine wave with the <em>amplitude</em> of 0.5 (see here TODO) and a frequence of 1Hz (1 complete cycle in 1s). The sample rate is 16Hz. Why? Because we have captured 16 samples in 1 second.</p>
<p>Given the information that we have a sample rate of 16Hz, we can simplify our time-value sequence to just a value sequence:
[ 0.0; 0.3; ...]</p>
<p>The point-in-time of the the n-th value in the sequence can easily be calculated when sample rate and starting time are given. This fact is fundamental, and leads to a definition of what <em>processing</em> means: <strong>Processing signal is creating or changing sequence of values</strong>.</p>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Real Time: Meistens will man Effekte oder erzeugte Klänge sofort hören - z.B. wenn man live spielt oder an seinem Computer-Musik Programm sitzt. D.h. wir sind nicht an Funktionen interessiert, die auf einer kompletten Sequenz arbeiten oder diese generieren, sondern an Funktionen, die einen Ausschnitt oder sogar nur <strong>Einzelwerte</strong> verarbeiten. So we are interested in functions that operate on these values. Beispiel: Live-Musik und Effektgerät: Nicht zuerst alles einspielen und dann den Effekt drüberlegen. Das alles soll quasi "sofort" passieren mit einer sehr geringen Latenz (Def: Latenz).</li>
</ul>
<p>We treat a 'sequence of values' like a stream instead of a random access persistent array, so that when we talk about signal processing, we mean 'steam processing' in this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>Composable (nicht immer als Ganzes schreiben) and reusable</li>
<li></li>
<li>Signale sind symmetrisch (schwingen um die Null-Linie). Das muss oft beachtet werden, wenn wir Algorithmen programmieren.</li>
<li>Mono</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2>Nachvollziehen: Die Beispiele können in VS Code / Ionide, F# Interactive nachvollzogen werden.</h2>

<h53></h53>
<p>There are two basic processing types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a new signal</li>
<li>Alteration of an existing signal</li>
</ul>
<p>From a practical point of view, distinguishing between creation and alteration is not relevant because creation is a special case of alteration, which we will see shortly.</p>
<p>But at first, let's look at <em>alteration</em>:</p>
<p>Given this input signal (a sine wave):
[TODO: Sinus]</p>
<p>Now we want to 'amplify' the sine wave in a way that the amplitude is not 0.5 anymore, but 1. This is easy since for each value in our input sequence, we can define a function that maps an input value to an output value by multiplication with 2.0:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
<span class="l">2: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="c">// float -&gt; float</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs1', 1)" class="fn">amplifyBy2</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 2)" class="id">inputValue</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs2', 3)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs2', 3)" class="id">inputValue</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">2.0</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now we assume there exists a 'helper' function that can take the 'amplify'-function and a input-value-sequence to produce the output-value-sequence. This function is called 'map' and can be used in this manner:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs3', 4)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs3', 4)" class="id">outputSequence</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="id">map</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs1', 5)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs1', 5)" class="id">amplifyBy2</span> <span class="pn">[</span><span class="id">TODO</span><span class="pn">:</span> <span class="id">Input</span><span class="pn">]</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>[ 1; 2; 3 ]   input
|  |  |
|  |  | --- amplifyBy2 transforms each value of input
v  v  v
[ 2; 4; 6 ]   output</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> This function operates on a single value, which means no 'past state or past input' is needed to perform the calculation. So it 'knows' nothing about the 'outer world', which means it has only ...</p>
<p>Let's have a look at creating a sequence of values. As stated before, creation of a value-sequence is a special case of alteration, because of this:</p>
<p>Alteration can be defined as "A transformation of n float-input-values into n float-output-values by applying a mapping function to each input-value".</p>
<p>Creation can be defined as "A transformation of n 'nothing'-input-values into n float-output-values by applying a mapping function to each input-value".</p>
<p>That sounds quite similar. How does this work, and: Can it work?</p>
<p>In F#, there is a type that represents nothing which is the 'unit'-type. The unit type has one instance, which is represented by '()'. To have a single character, we define an alias for '()' called 'o'.</p>
<p>[ o; o; o ]   input
|  |  |
|  |  | --- what is the transformation function?
v  v  v
[ a; b; c ]   output</p>
<p>Now it comes to an interesting aspect of 'pure' functional programming: In a 'pure' functional program, there is no concept of variables (or mutating state). There is nothing like true randomness which means that a function evaluates to the exact same value as in previous evaluations when the input values of that function are the same. A function itself cannot preserve state that is spanned over evaluations, and it cannot 'break out' of it's scope to call some random-number-generator or something. From an inner perspective of a function, the whole 'universe' of that function is the values that are visible to it (by passing them or having values captured by closure). This function has no identity; it doesn't remember anything from one evaluation to the next. At first view, this seems to be very limited compared to an imperative / object oriented approach with all it's changing state. And it seems like this abstraction doesn't fit well with our physical world where the current state is a product of all it's past states. We will revisit this later and see that it is not true.</p>
<p>However, having this limitation in mind, it's easy to understand that a sequence of 'nothings' can never be transformed in a sequence of values that differ from each other. It could only be transformed in (for example) a sequence of '3's. Here is an example:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs4', 6)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs4', 6)" class="fn">transformNothingToSomething</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span class="pn">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">3</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This results in:</p>
<p>[ o; o; o ]   input
|  |  |
|  |  | --- transformNothingToSomething
v  v  v
[ 3; 3; 3 ]   output</p>
<p>So how can it be possible to generate something like a sine wave out of nothing? Answer: It is not possible ("and why there is something at all and not nothing... I don't know."). To create a sine wave, there are more 'outer' values necessary than just nothing, which is evident when you look at how the sine function is defined: it needs an angle. This angle is in our case proportional to a point-in-time. With this insight, we can redefine what <em>creation</em> of signals mean:</p>
<p>"A transformation of n 'time'-input-values into n float-output-values by applying a mapping function to each input-value". In addition to the current 'time' value, we could also pass in the sample rate 'sr'.</p>

<p>Abgrenzung: AudioRate / ControlRate
Kann man prinzipiell beides machen. Hier geht es jedoch nicht um Control-Signale, sondern um Audio-Signale</p>
<p>Physik:
Oszillatoren, Filter - diese sind ganz prinzipiell State-behaftet. In unserer realen Welt passieren Dinge nicht einfach so. Vorgänge basieren aufeinander - Aktio und Reaktio - und das passiert wiederum deterministisch oder statistisch. Aus einer globalen Sicht hängen alle "Dinge" (dazu zählen Entitäten, deren Zustand sowie Vorgänge) voneinander ab und eine Möglichkeit, dies zu modellieren, ist diese: Es existiert eine Reihe von Entitäten, die einen oder mehrere Zustände haben. Übergänge von einem "Moment" zum anderen werden beschrieben als Änderungen dieser Zustände durch Berechnungen. Der nächste Moment wiederum ist auf die gleiche Weise zu ermitteln; diesmal jedoch auf dem eben geänderten Zustand. Dies kann fortlaufend - also iterativ - durchgeführt werden - e voila: Wir haben eine einschrittige Simulation.</p>

<p>This article will give you an introduction and a practical guide to digital audio signal processing in a language called F#. If you are already familiar with imperative (especially object-oriented) languages like Java or C#, you might wonder why a pure functional approach is helpful in a domain where mutable state over time is an inherent characteristic of the system.
(TODO: Ggf. hier abzweigen und kurz etwas zur Physik, zu Synthesizern, Effekten, Aktio-Reaktio und zur Tatsache sagen, dass "Dinge" Zustand haben).
In the analog world, physical quantities like the electric currency are used to represent a signal that is finally sent to a speaker. Thes quantities are created and altered by low-level components like condensors, resistors, magnetic coils, diods, etc. which are connected to each others in circuits.

</ul>
<p>Knowing that we are so far interested in functions that transform scalar inputs to scalar outputs, we will have a look at some simple examples of processing functions. Later on, we will see how we can compose these small functions to a larger systems.</p>
<h3>Amplifier</h3>
<p>Amplifying signals is a science for itself and one can spend a lot of money buying analog gear that sounds just "right" - where right is a subjective term based on user preferences. For us, a simple solution will be enough: Amplification of a signal in our context means: Scale values linearly. We can do that like this:</p>
<p>[Bild: Signal vorher - nachher]</p>
<p>Linear scaling of a value is mathematically just a multiplication, so that is indeed very simple. This function does the job:</p>

<p>We only write the "returning" type (float). The types of amount and i are infered. Can also write it with explicit types for all input params:</p>

<h3>Another example: Hard Limiter</h3>
<p>Now that we have our amplifier, we want to have the ability to "limit" a signal to a certain value.

<h2>Composing stateless processing functions</h2>
<h3>Serial Composition</h3>
<p>The amplify and limit functions are so small that we won't break them into smaller pieces for reusing them. They are kind of "atoms" in our context. But of course, we want to do the opposite: Compose them to larger, higher-level functions (that themselves can be composed again, to higher-level functions, and so on).</p>
<p>Let's say we want to build some nice distortion effect that is defined in this way:</p>

<p>The "drive" parameter controls how much distortion we want: 0 means no distortion; 1 means: a lot of distortion. We achieve this by a feeding the input into our amplifier. The output of the amp is then fed into a limiter. Let's call this technique of somposition <em>serial composition</em>.</p>
<p>We use explicit identifier ("amplified", "result") and evaluate our amp and limit functions. This can be a useful technique e.g. when we want to re-use the "amplified" value in a more complex scenario (which we will see shortly). For serial composition, there are alternatives that we can use to make our code more "compact":</p>

...inline the expressions. This is a bit sad because the signal flow is reversed: It is written limit, then amp. But the order of evaluation is amp, then limit. To make our code look more like the actual signal flow, we can use...</p>
<p>2)
...the pipe operator. The pipe operator is explained [here; TODO: Exkurs] and dows basically this: It applies the function on the left side and uses it's result to feed it to the function on the right side. How can that work?</p>
<p>[Bild: (float-&gt;float) |&gt; (float-&gt;float)]</p>
<p>Remember the previous chapter, it was remarked that currying was very important. Now we can see why: We said that we are interested in functions of form <em>float -&gt; float</em>, and now it's clear why: It enables us to compose functions in always the same manner. But when we review our amp function (and also the limit function), we see that they are float -&gt; float -&gt; float. This is because they not only transform an input value to an output value; they also require an additional parameter to control their behavior.</p>
<p>[TODO: weiterschreiben und Currying erklären; auch mit inneren Lambdas]</p>
<p>So, curryin can also be seen as a way of providing "factories for other functions". And it is important that we design our "factory functions" in a way that all parameters come first, then followed by the input value to have a float-&gt;float function at the end. When things get more complex in the following section, the technique of factory functions will help us a lot.</p>
<p>3)
Erklären; Blockschaltbild. This is nice, because it is just a "Bauanleitung" for a signal flow. Which means: We don't have to care about evaluating things. And we do not have to specify an "i" (input) explicitly; this "ergibt sich" from the composition itself.</p>
<p>[TODO: Depending on the character of the circuit, we will use a mix of all 4 forms.]</p>
<h3>Parallel Composition (Branch and Merge)</h3>
<p>TODO: Parallel doesn't (necessarily) mean parallel execution. This can be, but doesn't have to be.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what serial composition is, we know that it is useful to have functions of type float-&gt;float, and we understand that serial composition of these functions can be done by using the <em>&gt;&gt;</em> or <em>|&gt;</em> operators.</p>
<p>Let's extend our sample in a way where the techniques of serial composition is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The distortion effect we just engineered sounds nice, and we want to be able to "blend it in" together with a low-pass filtered version of the original signal. This low-pass signal shall be used for distortion, too. Visualizing this in a block diagram is easy [TODO: inhaltlich nicht korrekt (siehe Codebeispiel); viel mehr erklären]:</p>
<p>[BS_B]</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output value of "amp" is used in 2 following branches.</li>
<li>The output values of the 2 branches are then aggregated by the "mix" block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will look at a technique how we can map this behavior to F# code.</p>
<p>Think about what "branching" means: "Use an evaluated value in more than 1 place in the rest of a computation".</p>
<p>As usual, there are a lot of ways to achieve this, and I recommend taking some time and thinking about how this could be done. In our sample, we will use a very simple recipe: Each time we need branching, we bind an evaluated value to an identifier:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>

</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>By introducing the "amped" identifier, we are able to use it's value in more than one place in the rest of our computation. Merging is nothing more that feeding evaluated branches into an appropriate function. Note that in the code above, there comes the "mix 0.5" first, then the 2 branches. This is reversed to what is done in the block diagram. In appendix, there are alternatives that let the "mix 0.5" appear after the branches. TODO: See appendix (||&gt; bzw. ^&gt;)</p>
<h4>A note on "lowPass":</h4>
<p>Note that for now, we don't have a low pass filter, so we just use a placeholder function that works like a normal stateless processing function of type float-&gt;float:</p>

<h4>A note on "mix":</h4>
<p>As we can see, we need a "mix" function that has a "abRatio" parameter to control the amount of original and processed signal in the final output. 0 means: only signal a; 1 means: only signal b.</p>
<p>The function is this:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>

<!-- 
As we see, the function is not float->float anymore after all parameters have been applied; it is float->float->float. This is understandable because it needs 2 inputs instead of one. As a consequence, we cannot use "mix" as a processor for our audio runtime. But we can use it inside of a processor as an element in our computation:  -->
<p><strong><em> Festhalten:
Our rule is: Each time we branch a signal, we give it a name (there are alternative ways of branching that don't need identifiers (TODO: Alternative: arrows)).

<h4>A note on the signature of "blendedDistortion"</h4>
<p>TODO: It's again float -&gt; float. This is important because we can pass this function to our "audio runtime".</p>
<!-- 
<h3>Alternative notation</h3>
<p>Since we will later deal with blocks that have access to global and local "state", let's have a look at another way of writing the "blendedDistortion" computation function. This might look unuseful for now, but having that technique in mind, we will be able to understand it's value later and build other helpful techniques upon it.</p>
<p>The idea is to view the computation from above with it's identifiers as <em>nested functions</em>. These functions can then be composed by a powerful "composition function" that is written for the domain it shall be used in. This composition function is called "bind", and we define bind (for now) like this:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>

<span class="c">// with type annotations, bind looks like this:</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="id">bind</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span class="id">value</span><span class="pn">:</span> <span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">a</span><span class="pn">)</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span class="id">rest</span><span class="pn">:</span> <span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">a</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">b</span><span class="pn">)</span> <span class="pn">:</span> <span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="id">rest</span> <span class="id">value</span> <span class="c">// &#39;a -&gt; (&#39;a -&gt; &#39;b) -&gt; &#39;b</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>"bind" is simple: It takes a value and a "rest" function. The value is then applied to that function - that's all.</p>
<p>(Note that it is possible to leave out all float type annotations, and we get a generalized version of the bind function).</p>
<p>With bind, we can re-write our "blendedDistortion" function in a way that looks more like function composition (that itself is - of course - not a benefit in general; it's just a metter of taste. The benefit is another one - as we will see...):</p>

<p>TODO: Erklären:
Every time, a value has to be used more than once in the rest of the computation, we encode the rest of the computation as a "continuation" function with exactly one parameter. This function is composed with the "things that came before" with the "bind" (&gt;=&gt;) operator. We can then again use this technique <em>inside</em> of a "rest" function, and again, and again, with each continuation function having access to the parameters all "rest" functions that enclose it. In other words: A nested "rest" function has access to <em>all values</em> that are already bound to identifiers. This means that there is a data context built up that accumulates more values with each composition step that is accessible to the following parts in the computation.</p>
<p>Note: This way of composing functions is more powerful than the &gt;&gt; operator combines functions. &gt;&gt; builds a chain, where an element in the chain has access only to it's direct precessor; not to all precessors. There is no growing data context during the evaluation steps.</p>
<p>With "bind" in mind, we can revisit the block diagram of "blendedDistortion" that visualizes the pattern we just worked out:</p>
<p>[Bild_Schalenmodell]</p>
<p>Having identified a pattern for similar class of problems is a good thing. And it's getting even better because there are some benefits we haven't looked at so far and that will help a lot in other upcoming problems:</p>
<p>Benefit of having "bind":
<em> Hook
</em> Do things "behind the scenes"
<em> We gain control over the execution that is performed (usually, this aspect is fully out of the programmer's control).
</em> Aspects usually are "mixed" in the code; here, we can separate them in different "layers". TODO: Layer-Bild</p>
<p>Benefit: Wir bekommen mehrere Dinge unter unsere Kontrolle: Evaluierung und ... and with this in mind, we can make one step further.

<h3>Revisit Low Pass Filter</h3>
<p>In the last chapter, we treated the "Low Pass Filter" function as if it was pure, which means: From evaluation cycle to cycle, it doesn't "remember" anything; there is no information preserved between evaluations of the same function. In case of a filter, this cannot work, because filters need more than a single value: They deal with frequencies, and the concept of frequency requires a timespan: It's about how a sequence of values change ofer time. It's like with stock prices: You cannot say if there was a crash or if the market is hot by just looking at the current value. You need to look at the development of a price during a certain timespan. And, there are more things: Some filters only need some past input values (FIR; finite impulse response). But there are other filter designs that depend on their past output values (IIR; infinite impulse response). So we need a mechanism that preserves past input, past output (and maybe past intermediate) values.</p>
<h4>Very Brief theory of a low pass filter</h4>
<p>The most simple way of designing an electronic low pass is using a resistor and a condensor in series, which is then connected to a currency that represents the input signal. The output signal is the currency of the condensor. So why is that a low pass filter?</p>
<p>TODO: Bild</p>
<p>First, the resistor: It works like a valve in a water pipe: it limits the possibility of electrons to flow around. So when you connect the poles of a battery to each other, you will get a shortcut, because the electrons can go from one pole to the other without any obstacle (and releasing the battery's energy in a very short amount of time). But if you connect the poles to a resistor (e.g. a glowing lamp), the electron flow is limited (thus releasing the battery'S energy in a much longer timespan).</p>
<p>Second, the condensor: Basically, it works like a battery - it can store and release energy - only much faster. It is made up of 2 poles (e.g. metal plates). Each plate can be charged up with a certain amount of electrons; the more electrons it has, the higher the currency measured between the 2 plates. Connecting a battery to each plate, the electrons will flow from the 1 pole of the battery to the connected plate of the condensor, and the electrons from the other condencor plate will flow to the other pole of the battery. <em>After some time</em> (which depends on the dimension of the resistor), the condensor has the same currency as the battery, and it is then fully loaded. If you switch the connected battery poles (+ <> -), the condensor will first unload and then load again with switched currency direction, until it is in balance with the battery again.</p>
<p>Since the currency represents our input signal, we can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>High frequency is a fast change of currency.</li>
<li>High frequency is a slow change of currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when the input currency changes very quickly (high frequency), the condensor has not enough time to fill itself up with electrons, and if we measure it's currency, it will be almost zero. When the input currency changes slowly, the condensor has time for it's load and unload cycle, so we will be able to measure a currency (which equal approximately the input signal when the input frequency change is 0).</p>
<p>And that's out low pass filter: Low input frequencys can be measured at the condensor output, high frequencies have no effect on the measured condensor output currency.</p>
<p>The key point for this is: The condensor brings the time into the game! It has state, which is made up of the "current electron load". The next moment's output value is made up of the last moment's internal value and a current external input value.</p>
<p>How can that be modeled?</p>
<h4>State in the block diagram</h4>
<p>Let's describe the characteristics of this low pass filter in a textual way:</p>
<ul>
<li>An instance of low pass filter has state that represents the load amount. In our case, that state is proportional to the output value (like the amount of electrons is proportional to the output currency of the condensor).</li>
<li>
Calculation recipe for the output value from one moment to the next moment is:
<ul>
<li>Take the output value from the last evaluation (which we call "lastOut").</li>
<li>Take the difference between lastOut and the current input.</li>
<li>Multiply that difference with a given time constant (to slow down the load time and thus adjusting the cutoff frequency).</li>
<li>The current output value is that difference subtracted from lastOut.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. Think about it: The bigger the difference between current input and the last output value, the faster the condensor "loads up". The smaller the time constant gets, the slower the system reacts to input value changes - a low pass filter!</p>
<p>Let's see how we can implement it in a block diagram:</p>
<p>[lpf_inside.tif]</p>
<p>One interesting thing to notice: There is no state explicitly in a way that we store or memorize values. Instead, the state is modeled as the output value delayed by 1 sample ("t-1" block), which is then fed back into the next evaluation of the whole function. <strong>This is a key point</strong> because we can model any kind of local state in that way - no matter how they are structured or calculated. A abstract "block with state" can then be modeled like this:</p>
<p>[block<em>with</em>state<em>and</em>params.tif]</p>
<p>Beside the output value, there is an output state. And beside the input value, there comes an input state that is the output state from the last evaluation (plus curried function parameters - as usual).</p>
<p>In the following chapters, we will have a look on ways of composing such functions, and we will understand that these ways provide less or more compfort for the user who wants to express signal computations.</p>
<p>We start with an object oriented programming approach.</p>

<em> Kondensator modellieren mit Rückkopplung

<em> Identity in imperative lang is made by an address. Accessing the address is made by a name.
</em> BlockDiag: Identity (of the concrete LP filter instance) is made by it's location in the computation. --&gt;</p>
<!-- 
Now there are ceratin ways to deal with this:
<h4>Using lists of floats</h4>
<p>Instead of having processing functions that transform a single sample ("float -&gt; float"), we could use functions that operate on a whole sequence of samples (in the form of "seq<float> -&gt; seq<float>"). In that case, a processing function could use</p>
<p>TODO: Probleme:
<em> Latency
</em> endless signals: How long to wait?
* -&gt; Limit
--&gt;</p>
<h2>Writing stateful processing functions</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters, we wrote and composed pure (stateless) functions. This means that processing a signal (= a sequence of values) was made up of the following "recipe" (see chapter 1):
<em> We have a sequence of input values.
</em> We have a processing function.
<em> That function is curried, so that after application of all parameters values, a function of float-&gt;float remains.
</em> We have a "runtime" that generates an output sequence by mapping each value in the input sequence to a value in the output sequence by applying the processor function to an the input value.</p>
<p>[ 0.1  0.2  0.3 ]   input
|    |    |
|    |    |  --- Processing Function (here: multiply by 2)
v    v    v
[ 0.2  0.4  0.6 ]   output</p>
<p>This technique if easy and sufficient for a lot of use cases, but not for all. Imagine this task:</p>
<h3>Low Pass Filter</h3>
<p>"Apply a HPF (high pass filter) to a signal for 10 samples, then apply a LPF (low pass filter) to a signal for 10 samples, and so on."</p>
<p>There are several ways to achieve the desired behavior, and I would like to use the following "post-switch" approach as basis for the upcoming discussion:</p>
<p>We already have some building blocks for our task; the only one thing that is missing is the "counter" function to measure "10 samples".</p>
<p>The "counter" function can be described in this way:</p>
<p>"Write a function that outputs "1" for 10 samples. After these 10 samples, the output shall be made "0" for again 10 samples. After that, repeat from the beginning".</p>
<p>Having such a function, we can write a block diagram:</p>
<p>[Bs_C]</p>
<p>Now, there is a noticable thing:</p>
<p>Looking at the "counter" function used in the block diagram, you will notice that "counter" is special in a way that it has only a constant parameter (sample count of 10), but no input values available to transform; but it has an output value:</p>
<p>[ o  o  o  o  o  o  o  o ]   input
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | --- transform<em>nothing</em>to<em>different</em>values
v  v  v  v  v  v  v  v
[ 0  0  1  1  0  0  1  1 ]   output ('1's or '0's)</p>
<p>('o' means: no input value at all. In F#, this is represented by the <strong>unit</strong> type, that has an instance '()')</p>
<p>So here, we have a transformation from "nothing" to "something", and that "something" is not a constant; it differs from evaluation to evaluation. How can a function that has no information to work with evaluate to values that differ from each other? Answer: It can't. Conclusion: There must be some kind of (global, local, hidden, whatever) "state". In this case, it must be some kind of "local state" because the information needed is bound to that specific counter "instance".</p>
<h3>What is "state"?</h3>
<p>This question leads to an interesting fundamental difference of the functional and imperative programming paradigms: In a 'pure' functional program, there is no concept of variables (or mutating state). For example, there is nothing like true randomness, which means: A function evaluates to the exact same value as in previous evaluations when the input values of that function are the same. A function itself cannot preserve state that is spanned over evaluations, and it cannot 'break out' of it's scope to call some random-number-generator or something else. From an inner perspective of a function, the whole 'universe' of that function is the values that are visible to it (by passing them or having values captured by closure). A function call has no identity; it doesn't remember or "preserve" anything from one evaluation to the next. At first view, this seems to be very limited compared to an imperative (including object oriented) approach, where repeatingly writing to and reading from known places (memory) is essential here. And this seems to be a good analogy to our real, physical world we live in: It's all a product of actio and reactio. So it seems like the functional paradigm doesn't fit well into the domain of audio DSP, where it's often about modeling physical processes, and it seems to be not the right approach for modeling our "counter" task where the current state is a product of all it's past states.</p>
<h3>An Object Oriented Approach</h3>
<p>(You can find some more information in the appendix [here TODO].
<!-- In short, the important things are these: Locality implies that there must be some kind of "existence" of "things" over "time". So identity is made up of an address rather than by equal values. This is modeled by having addresses and pointer, which are accessible in a bigger context and preserved over a certain livetime. Then there is state that can be changed, because if it wouldn't be possible to change the instance state, the necessarity for having instances and pointers to them would not exist, because it wouldn't make a difference pointing to a thing or copying a thing. The behavior is the "gate" that everyone who wants to access (read or write) the instance state has to pass. This helps to ensure consistency during runtime by limiting access (mainly state changes) to special local places in the program. -->
)</p>
<p>So let's go for it using an object oriented approach at first and see where it leads us to.</p>
<p>"Object oriented programming is the thing with classes." I hear this sentence often, and it might seem true - not for all, but for the majority of mainstream OOP-languages. I think this doesn't capture the essence of object-oriented programming paradigm. A more basic definition of what OOP might be is when these 3 things occure together:</p>
<ul>
<li>References: Data is held in objects that have a referential identity (not a value-based identity).</li>
<li>Mutability: Object values can change over time, while it's identity remains (objects are mutable).</li>
<li>Encapsulation: Data access is protected via methods to help ensuring consistency during runtime (encapsulation of local state).</li>
</ul>
<p>These three characteristics can be seen as features, but in the same time, we have to deal with their consequences, and this has significant impact on how we write code. The upcoming OOP-samples use non-class techniques with functions as objects, because that is closer to what we will end up with. The approach is still object-oriented due to the fact that they have an identity that encapsulates mutable state:</p>

<h3>Using the FlipCounter</h3>
<p>TODO: Das stimmt nicht mehr; siehe oben::::::
Since we have a counter, we want to use it in a patch that works this way: Apply a HPF (high pass filter) to a signal for 10 samples, then apply a LPF (low pass filter) to a signal for 10 samples, and so on.</p>
<p>This can be expressed easily in a block diagram:</p>
<p>[TODO: Blockschaltbild]</p>
<p><strong><em> Side Note
For this concrete example, there is an alternativ to the concept of local state: The counter function could be modeled in a way that it gets passed in a global "time" or "current sample count" parameter alongside with the current input value. That value can then be used to deduce the state of the counter. We will see later how we can pass that "reader" state into a processing functions. But when it comes to generator functions (chapter TODO) that have to have the ability of being modulated, a concept of "local state" is necessary.

## Composing Stateful Objects

As the name already implies, we are first going to use an approach that <span class="k">is</span> called <span class="s">"Object Oriented Programming"</span><span class="o">.</span> What <span class="k">is</span> that?

<span class="s">"Object oriented programming (OOP) is the thing with classes."</span>

IMHO, that's not <span class="k">true</span>. It's <span class="k">true</span> that many <span class="k">object</span> oriented programming languages have a <span class="k">class</span> based type system <span class="o">-</span> but that's not the essence of OOP. Another definition of what OOP might be <span class="k">is</span> when <span class="n">3</span> things occure together:

<span class="o">*</span> References: Data <span class="k">is</span> held <span class="k">in</span> objects that have a referential identity (not a <span class="k">value</span>-based identity)<span class="o">.</span>
<span class="o">*</span> Mutability: Object values can change over time, <span class="k">while</span> it's identity remains (objects are mutable)<span class="o">.</span>
<span class="o">*</span> Encapsulation: Data access <span class="k">is</span> <span class="k">protected</span> via methods to help ensuring consistency during runtime (encapsulation of local state)<span class="o">.</span>

These three characteristics can be seen <span class="k">as</span> features, but at the same time, one has to deal with their consequences, and <span class="k">this</span> has significant impact <span class="k">on</span> how code <span class="k">is</span> written. The upcoming OOP-samples use non-<span class="k">class</span> techniques with functions <span class="k">as</span> objects and closures that capture mutable values. The approach <span class="k">is</span> still <span class="k">object</span>-oriented by the definition <span class="k">from</span> above, and differs fundamentally <span class="k">from</span> a pure functional approach <span class="k">where</span> we have no effects (no mutation) and only values (no references)<span class="o">.</span>

### Low Pass <span class="k">in</span> OOP

#### Implementation

Here <span class="k">is</span> our approach of implementing the low pass <span class="k">in</span> F# with OOP techniques. You will see that we don't use classes (although we could have used them), but the approach <span class="k">is</span> still <span class="k">object</span> oriented: TODO: Erklären, warum das OOP ist (ein Interface mit einer einzigen Methode; State ist gekapselt und wird geändert)<span class="o">.</span> Kein CQRS beachtet.

```fsharp

<p>What we have here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "lowPassCtor" is a factory function that evaluates to another function.</li>
<li>This resulting function can be evaluated giving a timeConstant parameter and an input value (it is again a function of float-&gt;float after applying all parameters).</li>
<li>It captures a mutable "lastOut" value, that initialized once when the lowPassCtor factory is called. That value changes each time the resulting function is evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code can be transformed to the block diagram of the low pass filter from (capter TODO) - try it!</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>In chapter 3 (TODO), we have already seen how we <em>would like</em> to use the low pass filter: Like a pure function. Here is again how:</p>

</table>
<p>But this won't work. We cannot just insert "lowPassCtor" in a pure computation. But why not - the compiler allows that? This true, but the ""blendedDistortion" function itself is pure: When it gets evaluated multiple times, it would always create a "new" lowPass by calling the lowPassCtor function, with lowPass's "mutable lastOut" field set to 0.0: It would never calculate anything useful. This issue can be solved by creating a "low pass" instance up front, and capture that reference in a closure. Doing so, we have to change our blendedDistortion processing function to a factory function (analog to the lowPassCtor):</p>

<p>Solving this issue is basically easy, but: TODO: Es bürdet dem Nutzer Arbeit auf, because we need to create a "low pass" instance up front, bind that function pointer (=reference) to an identifier that is again captured in a closure. Doing so, we have to change our blendedDistortion processing function to a factory function (analog to the lowPassCtor):</p>
<p>That works! But it's a burden for the user: Every time a stateful block is needed, it has to be created before it can be used inside of the computation, and the instance has to be removed when it is not needed anymore. When authoring more complex effects or synthesizers, this can be a major pain point: The user's focus is modeling a DSP patch, and not instance management. Since instance management is something that has to be done, it draws away attention from the primary goal and interrupts the workflow of the programmer.</p>
<p>So what can be done to automate instance management?</p>
<p>Looking again at the block diagram [TODO], there is one important thing to notice: Blocks themselves are not explicitly instanciated and then referenced by an identifier in the computation; they just sit in the place where they are used; they are kind of "inlined", even if they are based on their own local state.</p>
<p>So it seems that in the notation of block diagrams:</p>
<p>"...a function with state is not identified by a reference, but simply by it's position inside of a computation!"</p>
<p>This is also the case when composing pure functions, and this is what we want to achieve:</p>
<p><strong>Finding a way of treating stateful functions as if they were pure functions!</strong></p>
<p>An alternative explanation of what we want to achieve is:</p>
<p>Switch the reference model of state:
<em> From: A reference is made up of a unique address in a global address space.
</em> To: A reference is made up of
<em> a data structure which is implicitly defined by a computation,
</em> plus a local offset inside that computation.</p>
<p>Reaching this goal means: The user does not have to deal with instance management, because the aspect of local state would simply result from the way a computation is built by the user.</p>
<p>So finally, we know what this article is all about :)</p>

<h2>Composing Stateful Functions</h2>
<p>[block<em>with</em>state.tif]</p>
<p>The feedback of state is the key point: How can that be achieved? To find an answer, let's just ignore it for a moment. We assume that there will be something that can handle this issue for us. What remains is a function with "state in" and "state out" beside the actual in and out values:</p>
<p><img src="./block_with_state_no_feedback.tif" alt="block_with_state_no_feedback" /></p>
<p>Assuming that something passes in previous state and records output state, we can rewrite the object oriented low pass filter code from (TODO: Chapter 4) by transforming it to a pure function:</p>

</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>What have we done:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no mutable state anymore, since the previous state gets passed in as a function paratemer. Benefit: We don't need a "lowPassCtor" function anymore!</li>
<li>After application of the timeConstant parameter <em>and</em> the actual input value, the function has the signarure: <code>float -&gt; float * float</code>: Previous state comes in, resulting in a tuple that "packs" output state and an actual output value together.</li>
<li>Side note: The output state in the "low pass filter" implementation is the output value - but that's a special case here; it's not necessarily the case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Abstracting Instanciation</h3>
<p>Like stateless functions, we want to compose many of these stateful functions to build more high level computations. Since we not only want to compose blocks that work like a low pass filter (with float as state), we generalize the function, so that in the end, we are looking for a way to compose functions that look like this:</p>
<p><code>'state * float -&gt; 'state * float</code></p>
<p>Since <code>'state * float</code> is a significant thing which we will need more often, let's transform it to a named record type:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="id">BlockOutput</span><span class="pn">&lt;</span><span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">state</span><span class="pn">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="pn">{</span> <span class="id">value</span><span class="pn">:</span> <span onmouseout="hideTip(event, 'fs8', 24)" onmouseover="showTip(event, 'fs8', 24)" class="id">float</span><span class="pn">;</span> <span class="id">state</span><span class="pn">:</span> <span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">state</span> <span class="pn">}</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Then, the function signature looks like this:
<code>'state -&gt; BlockOutput&lt;'state&gt;</code></p>
<p>Let's name that function, too:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip highlighted"><code lang="fsharp"><span class="k">type</span> <span class="id">Block</span><span class="pn">&lt;</span><span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">state</span><span class="pn">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="id">Block</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="pn">(</span><span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">state</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="id">BlockOutput</span><span class="pn">&lt;</span><span class="id">&#39;</span><span class="id">state</span><span class="pn">&gt;</span><span class="pn">)</span>
</code></pre></td>

<p>Now the goal is to compose <code>fsharp 'stateA -&gt; Block&lt;'stateB&gt;</code> functions. And we also know:</p>
<p>The composition must handle the "recording" of the output state and feeding it into the next evaluation's input. This sounds like we just moved the key issue (instance management) into the composition layer. This is true - and beneficial - because we can "outsource" a recurring aspect of our programming model so that the user doesn't have to handle it anymore in a concrete way. We just made an abstraction!</p>
<h3>Pick up and Delivery</h3>
<p>So how can a composition function "record and feed back" state? Remember: We do not want to give a "name" or "address" to our blocks - their identity shall be solely based on their place inside the computation. The composition function itself shall consequently also be pure.</p>
<p>TODO: Stimmt das wirklich alles so genau?
Let's call the overall strategy "Pick Up and Delivery", and it shall work like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a whole computation, all blocks are evaluated one after another.</li>
<li>The actual value of an evaluated block is passed in the rest of the computation.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pick Up:</strong></p>
<p>The output states of the blocks are aggregated by accumulation: The output state of a block and the output state of a following block are packed together (in a tuple). This "state pack" shall be passed to the next block evaluation, that's output is then packed again with the state of that block, and so on. So in the end, we have:</p>
<p>state, packed together with the next state, that is packed together with next state, that is packed... Got it?</p>
</li>
<li>The final state pack that is emitted from the whole computation (alongside with the final actual output value) is then used as input state for the next evaluation cycle.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delivery:</strong></p>
<p>That nested state pack is then unpacked piece by piece, evaluation by evaluation - like a FIFO buffer. In that way, the local state of a block from the last evaluation is addressed and passen into the corresponsing block of the current evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- What we are looking for is a strategy on how to evaluate a computation that is made up of stateful functions. And there is an analogy that is easy to understand: Evaluating a whole computation means that the emitted state of the stateful functions has to be collected somehow. Our  -->

<p>Here, we treated lowPass as a pure function - which is what we wanted - but which also didn't work. We then used OOP that solved the issue, but forced us to create and manage references to instances.</p>
<p>Now that we have introduced Blocks and the "Pick Up and Delivery" strategy (implemented by the 'bind' combinator function), let's see how far we come.</p>
<p>We defined that bind takes a Block and the "rest of the computation". Since in a functional language, "rest of computation" is a function, we defined it as <code>float -&gt; Block&lt;'state&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In order to be able to do so, we have to
<em> "break up" the code sample from above into pieces of "rest functions",
</em> in the desired form,
<em> and do that every time a value from a Block is needed,
</em> and use 'bind' to compose the pieces.</p>
<p>Let's do it!</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
If you are already familiar with monads and/or F# computation expressions, you can skip this chapter. Otherwise, keep reading. A very good alternative source that explains monadic (and other ways of) composition can be found [here].</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
Our modified "blendedDistortion" sample is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain how "bind" is finally used;</li>
<li>understand in which way it relates to stateless computations;</li>
<li>see how we can simplify the syntax by using F#'s computation expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later (in chapter TODO), we will build up another, more comprehensible example with a focus on user's perspective, rather than on the aspects of composition itself.</p>

<p>Better! Now compare this code with the desired code from above: Every time we use a lowPass, there's not let binding anymore, but a bind, that takes exactly the expression on the right side of the let binding. The second parameter of bind is then the "rest of the computation", coded as a lambda function, that has a parameter with the identifier name of the let binding. Hard to read - but look at this picture:</p>
<p>[// TODO: Bild so wie in der Vortragspräsi]</p>
<p>We can introduce a prefix style operator as an alias for bind:</p>

<p>Now we are pretty close to the desired code, except that the identifiers of the lambdas are coming after the expression, but we will get rid of that, too in a minute.</p>
<p>There is one thing here: The code wouldn't compile. Remember that we defined bind in a way that it get's passed the "rest of the computation" as a function that evaluates to a Block? Look at the last lambda function: It evaluates to a float, not to a Block! But why? The answer is easy: It has no state, because the "mix" function is a stateless function, thus it evaluates to a float value and not to a Block. Solving this is easy, because we can turn a float value into a <code>fsharp Block&lt;unit&gt;</code> like this:</p>
<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l">1: </span>

<h3>Using F# language support for bind and return</h3>
<p>The syntax with our lambdas is close to the desired syntax, but we can get even closer. Luckily, what we did is so generic that F# (and a lot of other languages) has support for this kind of composition.</p>

<p>This looks really close to what we wanted to achieve, except that we have to wrap our code in the "patch" computation, and use let! instead of let every time we deal with Blocks.</p>
